Aaru TODO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So I don't like ORG-mode.  We're gonna do this old-school.


CURRENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[ ] Find a way around parsing strings for now, so I can get on with creating some frontend.
[ ] Get the backend API up as an MVP, which means spitting out JSON when hit with a POST

NEXT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[ ] Start developing the frontend.

FRONTEND STATUS
-------------------------
Redux has caused a lot of yak-shaving.
The fix is to build from the ground up:
1. build a form of the chunk thing that takes hardcoded testing data and keeps it in state.
2. build that to make an api call (without redux)
3. build redux into the app in it's most basic form
4. get chunks loaded into redux and served into the app
5. move the api call into redux

there may be more steps that have to be taken before things are truly working.  That said, there is a ton about react and redux that I simply cannot learn by doing all at once.
